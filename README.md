# Cosmic Attack!

This is a semester-long, gorup project created for the "Introduction to Software Engineering" course at the Univeristy of Florida. We were placed into groups of six, and we decided to use to project as a way to learn game design in Unity. While our ideas were ambitious, we could not implement all of ideas. Nonetheless, we created a fun space-shooter game and learned a lot about game design!

### Prerequisites

In order to test this game, you will need a Windows machine. Although this game could potentionally work on MacOS or Linux machines, we were never able to test it on them.

### Installing Demo

To get this demo onto your machine, first clone the branch titled "demo".

```
git clone -b demo https://github.com/nwilbur95/Group26Project.git
```
Once you have cloned the repo, navigate to the "Demo" folder in the project directory.

From here, click on the "Cosmic Attack!" icon to launch the application.

See documentation for instruction on how to play the game.
